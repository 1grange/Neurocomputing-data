The dataset comprises three distinct electricity load time-series from different regions and periods: (1) The 2010 Southern Australia dataset features 30-minute resolution data with seven parameters - hour, dry bulb temperature, dew point temperature, wet bulb temperature, humidity, electricity price, and electricity load - utilizing all features as inputs with load as output and a feature look-back window of 48 steps; (2) The 2018 Quanzhou, China dataset contains 15-minute interval recordings of six variables - load, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall - employing all features as inputs with load as output and a 96-step feature look-back window; (3) The 2023 Belgium dataset provides 15-minute resolution measurements of six meteorological and load parameters - humidity, surface wind speed, minimum temperature, temperature, maximum temperature, and load - using all features as inputs with load as target variable and a 96-step feature look-back window.
